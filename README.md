This User interface was developed to support the operational radar meterologists to calculate 
certain parameters required for issuing of Radar bulletin in India Meteorological Department

The software was developed by Pawan Kumar and Prayek Sandepogu to consolidate the various calculators and tools
which are used during issuance of cyclone bulletin. 

The software can be downloaded from the following link https://mega.nz/file/bR1kFYwQ#xqRr_knkPsucDXdxPZkZHyh5fQzQibLmBJ-z4mqEDEc
Once the file is extracted, The Cyclone tool exe can be used for utilization, the details for usage is available in the help button.

1) Calulate the radar beam height at a particular distance from the Radar to identify locations in Cyclone for
   reflectivity and radial velocity characteristics.

3) Find the speed and direction of movement of the cyclone based on the past and current coordinates
4) Plot the track of cyclone in the map for subsequent bulletins
